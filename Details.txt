Recap:

  Working with Array List using map ( Creates a new array of JSX elements )

  Use of Key

  Styling:
    Normal CSS vs Module CSS
  
  Take the JSON Data from reqres.in as JSON file no need to request

Topics:

  1. Events in react
      always use a named callback function

  2. Rendering

      React:
        process of rendering

          ReactDOM.createRoot --> creates virtual DOM from div id root

          then the render method renders the JSX Component APP/Whatever it is\
          using re-concillation process comparing the new manipuated vdom and the OLD VDOM/Real DOM, if any changes found propagate it to Real DOM
        
        conditional rendering:  
          {<boolean-value-evaluation> && ( JSX Element )}
          {<boolean-value-evaluation> ? (this JSX Element) : (that JSX Element)}

  3. State --> is value in the rendered JSX that changes during any events
      
      Pimary in React:

        ****** Do Not Touch Document Object in React ******

        it is CRIME if You do so
      
      rendering & re-rendering parts of react

        Normal JSX Syntax will render only once without any state hooks

      Hooks:
        Hooking setup between the memory of the JS and JSX Element

        when a memory of JS changes( Hook memory value ), JSX automatically re-renders

  4. Stateful & stateless component

      Stateful component is component which has a state value which changes

      Stateless -> Component which does not have a state value rather have only static values

      Props ---> static values passed during rendering
      State --> a value changes causing the re-rendering

     Create Multiple Components:
      Header
      LabelCard, InfoBox ( Can be put as a single using a flag isInfo )
      ImageBox, ImageCard ( Can be put as a single using a flag is isImage)
      HomeImage, FooterImage ( Can be put as a single using a flag is isMain )
